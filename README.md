# plenty_of_ricks
an implementation for making a dating app similar to Tinder and plenty of fish


This app is a way to play witht he rickandmortyapi for creating a fake dating app using typescript, angular, firebase and AUTH0 with mongoDB to store user profile information, The idea is to try and make use of the Rick_and_morty_api as much as possible. The api does not have much accept for the selection by CHARACTER , LOCATION and EPISODE. The app could first just be able to grab data and quickly use it to search for other data in the database. Give the Database a SWAGGER UI
